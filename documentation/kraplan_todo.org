This todo.org file is for recording tasks associated with the
${projectname} project.  Take a look at the [[][sprout doshit
guidelines]] for the details and the [[][sprout doshit tutorial]] for
more information on doing shit with doshit.

A quick summary of the guidelines:
 - No scheduled task should be expected to take more than six hours.
   If you don't know how long a task will take, create a TODO for
   figuring that out.
 - No scheduled task should be unassigned.  If you don't know who will
   do it, create a task for figuring that out and make someone
   responsible for following up.
 - No task should go without a deadline if it can be avoided.  If it
   is not clear when the deadline should be, do not set it
   arbitrarily.  Create another TODO for assessing how long the given
   task(s) will take and set a deadline on that.
 - Each TODO should be assigned to exactly one person.  If you want
   several people to do a task, copy and paste that task and tag each
   instance with their name.
 - Estimate how long a task will take, and be sure to track the time
   you spend on it, commenting as to what progress you made each time
   you clock in and out.  See [[][time tracking in doshit at sprout]]
 - The only person setting the priority of a task should be the person
   who is doing it.

If you're having any issues with doshit, drop [[mailto:doshit@sproutward.org][doshit@sproutward.org]] a
line, or drop by [[irc:/sprout/irc.freenode.net][#sprout]] on IRC.
